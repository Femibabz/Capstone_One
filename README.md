# Capstone_One
Springboard capstone one project on Apple app
## 1.0 Problem Summary
With millions of apps with similar functionalities around nowadays, mobile app analytics is a great way to understand the existing strategy to drive growth and retention of future users. Developers and investors can rely on users’ ratings to predict whether the overall rating for an app is more than 4 stars (which is assumed to be a good app) or not. The performance of an app based on user rating should inform decision-making on version update and functionality upgrade amongst other things. Hence, the goal of this project is to predict whether the overall rating for an app is more than 4 stars or not. This project set out to classify best performing iOS applications based on users’ ratings. On a general note, ratings serve as protection for both app users and investors to guard against time and financial investments in products/services that do not perform well in the market. Hence, the goal of this project is to predict whether the overall rating for an app is more than 4 stars (1=yes, 0=no). For this project, an app with 4 or more stars is assumed to be a very good app.
## 2.0 Approach Taken
 The project was addressed with data sourced from Kaggle and it was gotten from the iTunes search API at the Apple Inc website. The original data frame was made up of 5197 observations with 16 features (Table 1 lists all the 15 features excluding the rating column, which is the label’s column). The labeled column has Boolean variables of 1 and 0 that represented if the applications received ratings of more than 4 or not. Going by the nature of the label’s column, it could be seen that the project was a classification problem.

The data obtained was cleaned up to prepare it for modeling. All the apps were priced in USD. As a result, the currency column was dropped as it will have little to no impact on the model. Features ‘track_name’ and ‘desc’ were recorded in different languages, and they were processed with Natural Language (NL) processing technique using sklearn’s TfidfVectorizer. New features were generated from these two variables and the data frame columns increased from 16 to 4897. ‘track_name’ and ‘desc’ were dropped from the data frame. 
The content rating column contained only 4 unique values and they were of string data type. These
It should be noted that none of the observations had missing values in the data frame. This could be because the data was partly cleaned from the source before it was obtained for this project.
## 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis
The mean size of apps in the data frame was 197 MB. The biggest was 4gb and the smallest was 0.62mb. Other variables captured in descriptive statistics of the data frame can be seen in Table 2 below.

The pricing of the applications in the data frame ranged from 0 to $299.99. The mean price of the application in the data frame was $1.74. Also, the least and maximum supporting devices for any app were 9 and 47 respectively, while the average was 37. Perhaps, when the data frame was cleaned, missing observations in the language column were replaced with 0. This is a possible explanation for the least number of languages supported to be 0. On average, 5 languages are supported by the apps. Values were converted to integers so that they could be used as part of features for the modeling.

Using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the heatmap above was generated. No strong relationship can be seen between any of the variables in the data frame. 
There were 23 genres the apps were associated with game-based applications were the highest in the data frame, followed by entertainment and education. The least genre of apps in the data frame was catalog. The distribution of genres in the data frame can be seen in Table 3 below:
